      <Title>What is Stream Tracker?</Title>
      <Text>
      Stream Tracker was a discord bot that listened to discord status changes and tracked the progress of the new Glass Animals album "I Love You So Fucking Much". Once a user listened to 5 songs they got a code for the limited Roblox UGC "Glass Animals Turquoise Eye Head"

      <Text>
      Due to the sheer size of the Hazem Discord server, the bot had to listen to hundreds of thousands of Discord events in order to correctly process people's progress based on the songs they listened to.

        The bot itself was written in JavaScript with the popular discord.js library, this probably wanst the smartest choice but it ended up working out. Database wise we used mongodb together with the mongoose package for node.js
