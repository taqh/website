# Would you - Discord bot

Would You is a Discord bot that lets you play Would You Rather, Never Have I Ever, Higher or Lower, Truth or Dare and What Would You Do on Discord! It's built with discord.js and uses a MongoDB database to store the questions. The bot is hosted on Hetzner Cloud and uses a custom domain from Namecheap.

## Features

Would You features a variety of games to play with your friends on Discord. The bot is constantly being updated with new features and games to play. The bot is also open source and you can contribute to the project on GitHub.

Currently we have the following games:
- Would You Rather
- Never Have I Ever
- Higher or Lower
- Truth or Dare
- What Would You Do
- Random Topic

In addition to these games, the bot also provides a Question of the Day (QOTD) feature where a random question is sent to a channel every day. We aim to make the bot really customizable and easy to use. Almost anything in the bot can be customized to your liking. You can change the games, the questions, the cooldowns and much more. The bot also has a built in help command to help you get started with the bot.

## Featured on Discord

Would You has been featured on Discord multiple times.

In **November 2023**, Would You was featured on the official Discord Developers server as part of their Buildathon event. While the bot was added it was the most used bot during its stay and received a ton of positive feedback.

In **July 2024** we were featured on Discords "App Directory" page where we stayed for a couple of weeks. This was a huge milestone for the bot and we saw a huge increase in users during this time. Discord made sure to tell us before we were featured so we could prepare for the influx of users.

## Our Goal

We aim to make your server as fun and active as possible. Would You acts as an ice breaker for new servers and a fun game to play with your friends. We are constantly updating the bot with new features and games to play. We also have a support server where you can ask for help or suggest new features for the bot.
